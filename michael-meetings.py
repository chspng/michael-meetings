# michael-meetings.py

# input: 
#	list of names as text file
#	x number of output configurations

# output: 
#	x lists of names re-ordered each time

# notes:
#	if pairs of people should kept together, list them as john & jane in the text file input 
#	(to be modeled as a single person)

# algorithm:
#	1. order names (can be random or not)
#	2. randomly select starting point
#	3. Based on x, determine what step-size y to iterate by
#	4. Generate x lists, step through start-point by y
#	5. Randomize order of x lists



# test cases
